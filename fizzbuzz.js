// When a user inputs a number
let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: "));

// Loop from 1 to the entered number


// If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"


// If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"


// If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"


// Otherwise print the current number
